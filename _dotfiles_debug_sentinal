# If this file (.dotfiles_debug_sentinal) exists in the
# $HOME directory, it will cause, when a shell starts,
# for functions in ~/usr/bin/functions/dotfile.tracker.fn
# to be run when each dotfile (.bashrc, .profile, etc) is
# loaded, thus showing you what dotfiles are loading.
#
# In addition, when each dotfile is loaded, this file will
# be sourced.  Put code in here and it will run when each
# dotfile is entered and exited.  Here are a few exaples
# you can uncomment to watch the PATH variable or watch
# a directory

     echo -en "\033[38;05;214m"      # colorize output
     echo EDITOR:$EDITOR
     echo -en "\033[0m"              # stop colorizing
